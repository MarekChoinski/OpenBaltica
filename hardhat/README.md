# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
```

```shell
npx hardhat node
(on the other console:)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

Could be also checked on Ganache

## deploy NFT

`yarn hardhat deploy --network sepolia`
mint:
`yarn hardhat deploy --tags mintBasic --network sepolia`

you can see transactions here:
`https://sepolia.etherscan.io/`
on your wallet hash
